+++

# Abstract

Recent AI advancements, while impressive, often produce models that struggle to communicate and reason about uncertainty, make robust decisions under it, or transparently inform human users how the decisions were made. Bayesian methods offer a principled probabilistic framework for models to express uncertainty (namely, using probability), incorporate prior knowledge, and enable adaptive and interpretable decision-making. This year, our workshop focuses on challenges of the next frontier: Bayesian ways of thinking about problems and solutions needed in the era of generative AI models, including multimodal systems; enhancing robustness, efficiency and interpretability of decision-making systems; developing models capable of reasoning about uncertainty - for instance, reducing hallucination, proactive information-seeking, trustworthy co-creation, and others; and synergizing Bayesian principles with frontier generative AI - for instance, using pre-trained models as rich priors, guiding models to generate uncertainty-aware responses, and facilitating alignment with individual human users.

This workshop will bring together diverse researchers from related communities to exchange ideas, showcase applications, and collaboratively shape future Bayesian decision-making and uncertainty in today’s transformative era of AI, striving for methods that are scalable, robust, interpretable, and deeply integrated with modern AI's capabilities.
